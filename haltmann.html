          <div class="item-4x CharacterPageBodyText">
            <p>Max Profitt Haltmann, or simply President Haltmann, is a certified businessman, 
              the ambitious and cold-hearted CEO of the Haltmann Works Company, and the main 
              antagonist of Kirby: Planet Robobot.</p>
            <p>Likes: his company, numerals, inventions, analyzing celestial bodies and climates, 
              eating high-class chicken</p> 
              <p>Dislikes: opposition, other people, Kirby</p>

          <div class="item-8x CharacterPageBodyText">
            <p>Like certain real-life CEOs, Haltmann is willing to do whatever he can to make his 
              company profit (it's in his name!). In his case, it means invading and mechanizing 
              other planets for their resources. The last part actually sounds pretty familiar 
              but I won't say anything else about it.</p>
          <p>He believes he's intellectually superior to the natives of other planets and feels 
              they are savages with no manners, which explains why he has no problems invading 
              their homes. Yes, he's a colonizer.</p>

            <p>Haltmann is very proud of his mech, the Executive Suit, with its gold body adorned 
            with lilac and red gems. He is also very proud of his hovering golden chair, which he 
            uses when he's not piloting his mech. Fit for a CEO, don't you think?</p>

      <h2 class="item-8x sectionSubheader">Before Kirby: Planet Robobot (Backstory)</h2>
      <div class="item-4x CharacterPageBodyText">
        <p>Haltmann and his daughter, Susie, used to travel throughout the cosmos together. At one 
          point discovered Star Dream, a wish-granting supercomputer, and its blueprints. He was 
          able to partially reactivate Star Dream with the help of the blueprints and by researching 
          the universe's most advanced civilizations.</p>

        <img class="item-4x wideImage" src="images/HaltmannSusie.png" alt="Haltmann and Susie"></img>
      </div>

      <div class="item-8x CharacterPageBodyText">
        <p>Haltmann conducted tests on Star Dream regularly, until there was an accident, resulting in 
          Susie being warped to another dimension. Believing Susie had died, Haltmann decided to spend 
          all his time and energy into fully reactivating Star Dream. He hoped that he could revive his 
          daughter and see her again. However, he lost his memories of her the more he relied on Star 
          Dream.</p>
        <p>It turned out that Susie was not dead, but when she came back, Haltmann did not recognize her. 
          Haltmann ended up hiring her as secretary and administrative assistant of the Haltmann Works 
          Company, as deep down he felt she was familiar.</p>
        <p>With Susie now part of the Haltmann Works Company team, Haltmann was ready to proceed with his 
          business plan of eternal prosperity: the Mechanization Occupation Project.</p>
      </div>
      

      <h2 class="item-8x sectionSubheader">During Kirby: Planet Robobot</h2>
      <div class="item-8x CharacterPageBodyText">
        <p>The Haltmann Works Company's latest mechanization target is Planet Pop Star, thank to its large amount
          of resources and 'uncivilized' natives. Haltmann, however, doesn't appear in person until close to the 
          end of the game, when he introduces himself to Kirby and reveals his business plan and intents to destroy 
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Haltmann doesn't succeed (lol) and is knocked unconscious. Once he wakes up, he attempts to summon Star 
          Dream, who absorbs his soul and possesses him. Through Haltmann' body, Star Dream states that all life forms 
          are getting in the way of Haltmann's plans of economic prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>Kirby eventually manages to destroy Star Dream' original body, which results in the end of both 
          Star Dream and Haltmann. All of the planets that the Haltmann Works Company had mechanized were reverted 
          to their normal states.

      <h2 class="item-8x sectionSubheader">Non-Canon Information</h2>
      <div class="item-8x CharacterPageBodyText">
        <p>Star Dream Soul OS, fought in The True Arena, begins to erase Haltmann's soul as it's no longer 
          needed to function properly. While his soul is being erased, Haltmann wonders why he reactivated 
          a machine as terrible as Star Dream, and ultimately remembers Susie and his wish to see her again. 
          He regrets believing that Star Dream would have ever been able to grant that wish. Star Dream Soul 
          OS successfully deletes all remaining traces of Haltmann, including both his memories and soul.</p>
