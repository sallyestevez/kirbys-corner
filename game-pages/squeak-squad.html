        <p>“Early afternoon in Dream Land... It's so peaceful even the clouds are drowsy. 
          And now it's Kirby's favorite time of day — snack time. Today's yummy snack is 
          a sweet, fluffy slice of strawberry shortcake! Time to dig in... WHOA! The cake 
          Kirby was about to eat has suddenly vanished! That scrumptious berry-topped slice 
          of mouthwatering goodness... No doubt about it! This must be the work of that 
          greedy King Dedede! Well, there's no time to waste! Gotta get that cake back! 
          And that's how Kirby's latest fantastic adventure begins...” ~ Kirby Squeak Squad

        <p>After Kirby's precious strawberry shortcake is stolen, he suspects that King Dedede 
          is the culprit, so he heads to Castle Dedede to teach him a lesson and get his cake back.

        <p>On the way there, Kirby finds treasure chests. Unfortunately, he also encounters the Squeaks, 
          a band of thieving mice whose goal is to steal all the treasure in Dream Land. After The Squeaks 
          attempt to steal the treasure chests Kirby found, Kirby believes they are the ones who stole his 
          strawberry shortcake. However, he doesn't realize this until after he defeats Dedede, since the 
          Squeaks also show up to steal Dedede's stuff.

        <p>This is when Kirby's adventure truly begins. Kirby chases the Squeaks through different worlds 
          (Nature Notch, Cushy Cloud, Jam Jungle, and Vocal Volcano) to try to get his cake back. This goes 
          on until he manages to find the Squeaks' leader (along with a treasure chest, of course).

        <p>Kirby comes face-to-face with the leader of the Squeaks, Daroach, in Ice Island. Kirby fights 
          Daroach for the treasure chest Daroach is holding (maybe Kirby's shortcake is in there?), and 
          succeeds! Unfortunately, Meta Knight comes in and grabs the chest, leaving Kirby without it.

      <div class="item-8x GamePageBodyText">
        <p>Kirby chases Meta Knight all the way to Secret Sea. The two fight, with Kirby getting the chest 
          after defeating Meta Knight. Just as Kirby is about to open the chest, Daroach comes in and opens 
          it himself. It turns out that Kirby's cake was never inside; darkness was in it all along.

        <p>The darkness possesses Daroach, who flies off to Gamble Galaxy. Kirby follows and fights the 
          possessed version of Daroach (now referred to as Dark Daroach).
        </p>
        <p>After Dark Daroach is defeated, the darkness leaves Daroach alone and reveals its true form, 
          a black-colored star called Dark Nebula. Daroach gives Kirby his Triple Star cane, which Kirby 
          uses to defeat Dark Nebula. Kirby chases Dark Nebula through the cosmos and faces off in an 
          intense battle. Kirby defeats Dark Nebula, who explodes shortly after.

        <p>The evil has been defeated, and Kirby is free to go home. Kirby is a hero once more, although 
          he was never able to find his strawberry shortcake... or so he thinks. The Squeaks return Kirby's 
          cake at the very end of the game, and Kirby is happy once more.
