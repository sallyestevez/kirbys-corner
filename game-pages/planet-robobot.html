      <h3 class="item-8x">It's Mecha Anime Kirby!</h3>
      <div class="item-4x GamePageBodyText">
        <p>It's a regular day on Planet Pop Star, Kirby's homeland. That is, until 
          you see a giant spaceship in the distance. This ship, the Access Ark, is 
          the home of the Haltmann Works Company. You can't help but watch as the 
          Access Ark invades and mechanizes your planet. Or you attempt to fight 
          back, like King Dedede and Meta Knight, and fail. Or maybe you're Kirby, 
          who sleeps through the whole thing.
        </p>
        <p>Eventually, Kirby wakes up and sees that his planet has been completely 
          transformed, so he decides to go on an adventure to turn Pop Star back to 
          normal.

      <div class="item-8x GamePageBodyText">
        <p>Kirby travels through some locations (Patched Plains and Resolution Road) 
          and fights some enemies (Clanky Woods and Holo Defense API) before eventually 
          meeting Susie, Haltmann Work Company's secretary and administrative assistant, 
          in Overload Ocean.
        </p>
        <p>Through Susie, Kirby learns that her company is extracting Pop Star's resources, 
          and the planet's natives are getting in the way of doing this. In her eyes, they're 
          obstacles. Susie's attempt to defeat Kirby fails, so she runs away for now.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="item-4x GamePageBodyText">
        <p>Kirby finds Susie again, this time at Gigabyte Grounds. Susie sings the Haltmann 
          company theme song (called 'The Noble Haltmann') and tells Kirby that Meta Knight 
          was captured and transformed into a cyborg (Mecha Knight). Kirby defeats Mecha 
          Knight and proceeds to Rhythm Route.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item-8x GamePageBodyText">
        <p>Kirby meets Susie (again). She sings The Noble Haltmann (again) and introduces 
          the Dedede Clone, created from, you guessed it, King Dedede's DNA. The Dedede 
          Clone attempts to fight Kirby but fails. Kirby moves on ahead to the Access Ark.
        </p>
        <p>Kirby infiltrates the Access Ark and after defeating more robots, makes it to 
          the office of the president of the Haltmann Works Company. Susie is there once 
          again, scolding Kirby for his lack of manners. She introduces a new and improved 
          version of Mecha Knight, Mecha Knight+, which Kirby has to fight. Kirby defeats 
          Mecha Knight, and Meta Knight is free from Susie's control. President Haltmann 
          reveals himself, dismisses Susie from his office, and confronts Kirby himself.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item-4x GamePageBodyText">
        <p>According to Haltmann, Haltmann Works Company has reactivated the supercomputer 
          Star Dream after studying some of the universe's most advanced civilizations. 
          Haltmann fights Kirby in his own mech, but Kirby ends up defeating him (who 
          would have guessed? Haha). Exasperated by the world's “savages,” Haltmann 
          attempts to activate Star Dream, who ends up taking control of Haltmann's body.

      </div>
      <div class="item-8x GamePageBodyText">
        <p>Star Dream, through Haltmann, announces its intent to wipe out all life in 
          existence, as the universe's life forms are getting in the way of the Haltmann 
          Works Company's eternal prosperity. Susie (she is still here!) realizes what is 
          happening and asks Kirby to stop Star Dream. Kirby sets off to space, where Star 
          Dream is now located.

      </div>
      <div class="item-4x GamePageBodyText">
        <p>Star Dream takes control of the entire Access Ark and becomes a sentient planet. 
          After Kirby breaks off pieces of the Access Ark's shell, it is revealed that it 
          is actually a Galactic Nova, one of the clockwork stars that float through the 
          cosmos and grant wishes.
        </p>
        <p>In order to defeat Star Dream for good, Kirby's Robobot armor's hand turns into 
          a giant screwdriver. Star Dream is screwed in half and explodes along with Haltmann. 
          The explosion undoes Pop Star's mechanization, and Kirby returns to Pop Star. 
          Capitalism has been defeated (at least in the Kirby universe).
