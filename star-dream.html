            <p>Star Dream was initially built by the Haltmann Works Company as a wish-making robot 
              and Mother Computer, but it eventually became sentient and formed its own objective: 
              the destruction of all of the organic life forms in the universe.</p>

            <p>After finding blueprints and studying ancient technology, President Haltmann was able 
              to start rebuilding Star Dream. During testing, however, an accident occurred and 
              Haltmann's daughter was transported to another dimension. Believing she was dead, 
              Haltmann used Star Dream's wish-granting capabilities to bring her back, but was 
              unsuccessful.</p>
          <p>This reliance on the incomplete Star Dream caused Haltmann to slowly lose his memories 
              of his daughter and his compassion. As a result of this, Haltmann had a new goal for 
              his company: infinite prosperity. With the help of Star Dream, Haltmann believed he 
              could reach his goal by invading planets and harvesting their resources.</p>
          <p>After losing to Kirby, Haltmann activates Star Dream. Star Dream, who had previously 
              absorbed Haltmann's memories, now absorbs his soul and becomes a sentient being. 
              Star Dream uses Haltmann's body to reveal its plans of prosperity by wiping out 
              all life, and sets off to fulfill these goals.</p>

            <p>Star Dream's plans fail when Kirby uses his Robobot armor to drill through its body, 
              destroying the computer and whatever remained of Haltmann for good.</p>
