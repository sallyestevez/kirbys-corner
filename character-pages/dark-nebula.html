      <div class="item-8x CharacterPageBodyText">
        <p>Dark Nebula is a very powerful and evil being. Due to this power, it was sealed inside 
          a chest. Eventually, this treasure chest ended up in Dedede’s possession for unknown 
          reasons. Daroach figures out what’s inside the chest, and steals it from King Dedede. 
          Kirby chases after Daroach since he thinks his cake is inside the chest.</p>
        <p>Kirby fights Daroach for the chest and wins, but shortly after the chest is stolen by 
          Meta Knight. Kirby fights Meta Knight for the chest and also wins. Just as Kirby is about 
          to open the chest, Daroach comes in and opens it himself.</p>
        <p>Dark Nebula, taking the form of darkness, possesses Daroach, who turns into Dark Daroach. 
          Kirby frees Daroach from Dark Nebula after fighting him.</p>

        <p>Shortly after, Dark Nebula reveals its true form, a dark star with an eye. Kirby fights 
          Dark Nebula, who switches between its different forms. After it is defeated by Kirby, it 
          disintegrates and eventually explodes.</p>
