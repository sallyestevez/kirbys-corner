      <div class="item-8x CharacterPageBodyText">
        <p>Susie's father, Haltmann, performed tests on Star Dream, a machine he reactivated. 
          Unfortunately, there was an accident during one of the tests and Susie was transported 
          to another dimension.
        </p>
        <p>Years later, Susie somehow made her way back from the other dimension and interviewed 
          for the Haltmann Works Company. Haltmann, despite no longer having memories of her due 
          to all of his Star Dream tests, felt Susie was familiar and decided to hire her as Haltmann 
          Works Co.'s executive assistant and secretary. Is it truly nepotism at work if Haltmann 
          doesn't remember who Susie is?
        </p>
        <p>With Susie now part of Haltmann Works Co., President Haltmann put her in charge of the 
          company's Mechanizing Occupation Project.</p>

      <h2 class="item-8x sectionSubheader">During Kirby: Planet Robobot</h2>
      <div class="item-8x CharacterPageBodyText">
        <p>The Haltmann Works Company invaded Planet Pop Star after making it the next target 
          of the company's Mechanizing Occupation Project.</p>
        <p>Kirby first meets Susie at Overload Ocean, where she formally introduces herself to him 
          and explains why the invasion is happening. Susie tells Kirby that Pop Star's natives take 
          the planets resources for granted, and that Kirby has to be destroyed. The two fight, with 
          Kirby prevailing. Susie leaves.</p>
        <p>Kirby encounters Susie again, this time in Gigabyte Grounds. Susie tells him the story about 
          the time she met a powerful knight, which turned out to be Meta Knight. It turns out that Susie 
          captured Meta Knight and turned him into a cyborg. Susie has Kirby fight Mecha Knight, Meta Knight's 
          cyborg form, and leaves.</p>
          <p>Kirby encounters Susie yet again at Rhythm Route. She greets Kirby and releases Dedede Clone, 
            leaving Kirby to fight it.</p>
          <p>Susie is encountered again inside of the Access Ark. Susie scolds him for entering the place 
            as if it was his own living room. She has Kirby fight Mecha Knight+, an upgraded version of 
            Mecha Knight, and leaves.</p>
          <p>Susie is surprised that Kirby managed to defeat Mecha Knight twice. She gets ready to fight 
            Kirby once more, but is interrupted by President Haltmann. Kirby defeats President Haltmann, 
            who then access Star Dream. Just as Haltmann is about to put on Star Dream's control helmet, 
            Susie comes in and takes the helmet. She reveals her secret plan: to steal Star Dream and sell 
            its database to a start-up company for a large profit. Before she is able to do this, Star Dream 
            becomes sentient and knocks Susie unconscious after blasting her with a laser.</p>
          <p>After President Haltmann is possessed by Star Dream, Susie urges Kirby to stop Star Dream. After 
            Star Dream is eventually defeated and the mechanized planets are reverted back to normal, Susie then 
            flies off into space.</p>
