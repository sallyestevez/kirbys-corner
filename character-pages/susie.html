        <p>Susie's father, Haltmann, performed tests on Star Dream, a machine he reactivated. 
          Unfortunately, there was an accident during one of the tests and Susie was transported 
          to another dimension.
        </p>
        <p>Years later, Susie somehow made her way back from the other dimension and interviewed 
          for the Haltmann Works Company. Haltmann, despite no longer having memories of her due 
          to all of his Star Dream tests, felt Susie was familiar and decided to hire her as Haltmann 
          Works Co.'s executive assistant and secretary. Is it truly nepotism at work if Haltmann 
          doesn't remember who Susie is?
        </p>
        <p>With Susie now part of Haltmann Works Co., President Haltmann put her in charge of the 
          company's Mechanizing Occupation Project.</p>
