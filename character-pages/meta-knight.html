        <p>Meta Knight is a major character in the Kirby series. He's a highly skilled, 
            but mysterious, swordsman who wears a silver mask and a dark purple cape.

    <div class="item-8x KirbyPageBodyText">
      <p>He was first introduced as an antagonist in Kirby's Adventure (1993), but in 
        more recent games he's appeared as one of Kirby's allies and sometimes even a 
        playable character.
      <!-- </div> -->
        He never reveals his face, except in rare occasions when his mask is broken. His signature weapon is Galaxia, a golden sword. 
        
        Meta Knight is the leader of the group of warriors known as the Meta-Knights. He is also the captain of his airship, the Battleship Halberd.
        
        Despite being a very serious character, Meta Knight is also known to have a softer side and cares a lot about those close to him. It is also rumored that Meta Knight has a sweet tooth.

      <p>Kirby is a cheerful and positive being who cares about those close to him. He is always willing 
        to help those around him, even going out of his way to do so. He's also very brave, not being 
        afraid to fight eldritch abominations when necessary. That doesn't mean Kirby isn't forgiving, 
        as he can become friends with those he's fought in the past. Examples of enemies to friends 
        include King Dedede, Magolor, Susie, and Meta Knight.

      <p>Kirby's favorite things to do are eat and sleep. When he's not busy saving the world from 
        active threats, he's sleeping. And when he's not sleeping, he's eating.
