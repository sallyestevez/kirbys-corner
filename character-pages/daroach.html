        <p>Daroach is the leader of the Squeaks and one of the antagonists in Kirby Squeak Squad.</p>
        <p>He is a mischievous mouse who wears a top hat and a red cloak. He has magical powers 
          and is usually seen with a magic wand and the Triple Star cane.</p>
        <p>Daroach loves treasure and, along with the rest of the Squeaks, travels around the 
          planet looking for valuable goods. It's a way of life for them.</p>

        <p>One member of Daroach's gang, the Squeaks, steals Kirby's beloved strawberry shortcake. 
          Thinking Dedede was the culprit, Kirby travels to Dedede's castle to try to get it back. 
          At Dedede's Castle, Kirby encounters Daroach and the other the Squeaks, who are there to 
          steal Dedede's treasure. That's when Kirby realizes that the Squeaks are the true culprits 
          of his missing cake. Believing that his cake is inside the treasure chest the Squeaks stole, 
          he chases after them.</p>
        <p>Daroach makes some appearances during Kirby's travels, but Kirby doesn't face him in a fight 
          until he reaches Ice Island towards the end of the game. Kirby and Daroach face off, with 
          Daroach using his magic attacks and Triple Star to attack Kirby. Kirby manages to defeat 
          Daroach, who gives up the treasure chest. Unfortunately, Meta Knight appears and steals the 
          chest immediately after.</p>
        <p>Kirby chases after Meta Knight and the two fight. Kirby succeeds once more, and Meta Knight 
          surrenders the chest. However, before Kirby can open it, Daroach appears and steals the chest. 
          Once Daroach opens it, he becomes possessed by powerful darkness, becoming Dark Daroach. He 
          heads off to Gamble Galaxy, where Kirby must fight him once more. Kirby defeats Daroach, freeing 
          Daroach from the darkness, which is revealed to be the true antagonist, Dark Nebula.</p>

        <p>Kirby uses Daroach's Triple Star cane in his fight with Dark Nebula and manages to defeat 
          it once and for all.</p>
        <p>After Dark Nebula is defeated, Daroach and the other Squeaks return Kirby's strawberry shortcake 
          as a way of apologizing to him for the trouble they've caused.</p>
