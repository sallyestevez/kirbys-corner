        <p>After a member of the Squeaks steals Kirby's strawberry shortcake, Kirby chases 
          the Squeaks through different worlds. Occasionally, the Squeaks ambush Kirby in 
          an attempt to steal the treasure chests he has collected during his journey.</p>
        <p>The Squeaks' leader, Daroach, is possessed by Dark Nebula. Daroach is freed after 
          Kirby fights and defeats him.</p>
        <p>After Kirby defeats Dark Nebula, Daroach and the Squeaks thank Kirby and return 
          his strawberry shortcake.</p>
