        <p>He's pink. He's round. And he's puffy. He's been on countless
          adventures, and he's saved his planet, Pop Star, tons of times, too. He can 
          inhale enemies and gain their powers. He's been around for over thirty years and is loved by all. His games are
          so sweet that he'll give you a sugar rush. And he's so cute that you can't help 
          but smile. Do you know his name? It's Kirby!

      <div class="item-8x KirbyPageBodyText">
        <p>Kirby has been in over 30 games, starting with Kirby's Dream Land in 1992. 
          Since then, he has starred in Kirby's Adventure (1993), Kirby Super Star (1996), 
          Kirby Air Ride (2003), Kirby: Planet Robobot (2016), Kirby: Star Allies (2018), 
          Kirby and the Forgotten Land (2022), and many other titles.

      <div class="item-8x KirbyPageBodyText">
        <p>Kirby is a cheerful and positive being who cares about those close to him. He is always willing 
          to help those around him, even going out of his way to do so. He's also very brave, not being 
          afraid to fight eldritch abominations when necessary. That doesn't mean Kirby isn't forgiving, 
          as he can become friends with those he's fought in the past. Examples of enemies to friends 
          include King Dedede, Magolor, Susie, and Meta Knight.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item-4x KirbyPageBodyText">
        <p>Kirby's favorite things to do are eat and sleep. When he's not busy saving the world from 
          active threats, he's sleeping. And when he's not sleeping, he's eating.

      <div class="item-4x KirbyPageBodyText">
        <h3>Inhale</h3>
        <p>Kirby's inhale, introduced in Kirby's Dream Land, is one of his most well-known abilities. 
          As the name implies, Kirby can inhale enemies and objects. He can either swallow what he 
          inhaled or spit it out, which is known as a star spit. In later games, swallowing certain 
          enemies gives Kirby a Copy Ability.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item-4x KirbyPageBodyText">
        <h3>Copy Abilities</h3>
        <p>Copy Abilities were first introduced in Kirby's Adventure. After inhaling and swallowing certain
          enemies with special powers, Kirby can also gain those powers. There are over 40 Copy Abilities in 
          the series, and each Copy Ability has a unique moveset! Starting in Kirby Super Star, Kirby also gets
          a unique hat for each Copy Ability.

      <div class="item-4x KirbyPageBodyText">
        <h3>Helpers</h3>
        <p>In Kirby Super Star (+ Super Star Ultra) and Kirby Star Allies, Kirby can create a Helper by giving 
          up a Copy Ability! Helpers are allied versions of the previously swallowed enemy.

      <div class="item-4x KirbyPageBodyText">
        <h3>Water Gun</h3>
        <p>Kirby can't use most of his Copy Abilities underwater, but he can use a water gun attack. 
          Kirby shoots a bubble of water in the direction of the player's choice.

      <div class="item-4x KirbyPageBodyText">
        <h3>Hover</h3>
        <p>Kirby can inflate himself and flap his arms to hover. Exhaling will cause Kirby to deflate, 
          and the exhaled air can deal damage!
