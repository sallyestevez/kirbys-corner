      <p>He's pink. He's round. And he's puffy. He's been on countless
        adventures, and he's saved his planet, Pop Star, tons of times, too. He can 
        inhale enemies and gain their powers. He's been around for over thirty years and is loved by all. His games are
        so sweet that he'll give you a sugar rush. And he's so cute that you can't help 
        but smile. Do you know his name? It's Kirby!

    <div class="item-8x KirbyPageBodyText">
      <p>Kirby has been in over 30 games, starting with Kirby's Dream Land in 1992. 
        Since then, he has starred in Kirby's Adventure (1993), Kirby Super Star (1996), 
        Kirby Air Ride (2003), Kirby: Planet Robobot (2016), Kirby: Star Allies (2018), 
        Kirby and the Forgotten Land (2022), and many other titles.

      <p>Kirby is a cheerful and positive being who cares about those close to him. He is always willing 
        to help those around him, even going out of his way to do so. He's also very brave, not being 
        afraid to fight eldritch abominations when necessary. That doesn't mean Kirby isn't forgiving, 
        as he can become friends with those he's fought in the past. Examples of enemies to friends 
        include King Dedede, Magolor, Susie, and Meta Knight.

      <p>Kirby's favorite things to do are eat and sleep. When he's not busy saving the world from 
        active threats, he's sleeping. And when he's not sleeping, he's eating.

          <p>Kirby's inhale, introduced in Kirby's Dream Land, is one of his most well-known abilities. 
            As the name implies, Kirby can inhale enemies and objects. He can either swallow what he 
            inhaled or spit it out, which is known as a star spit. In later games, swallowing certain 
            enemies gives Kirby a Copy Ability.

          <p>Copy Abilities were first introduced in Kirby's Adventure. After inhaling and swallowing certain
            enemies with special powers, Kirby can also gain those powers. There are over 40 Copy Abilities in 
            the series, and each Copy Ability has a unique moveset! Starting in Kirby Super Star, Kirby also gets
            a unique hat for each Copy Ability.
