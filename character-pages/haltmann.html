    <h3 class="item-8x">Who put capitalism in my Kirby?</h3>
    <div class="item-4x CharacterPageBodyText">
      <p>Max Profitt Haltmann, or simply President Haltmann, is a certified businessman, 
        the ambitious and cold-hearted CEO of the Haltmann Works Company, and the main 
        antagonist of Kirby: Planet Robobot.
      </p>
      <p>Likes: his company, numerals, inventions, analyzing celestial bodies and climates, 
        eating high-class chicken
      </p>
      <p>Dislikes: opposition, other people, Kirby</p>
    </div>
    <div class="item-4x">
      <img class="item-4x wideImage" src="../images/Haltmann.png" alt="Haltmann"></img>
    </div>
    <div class="item-8x CharacterPageBodyText">
      <p>Like certain real-life CEOs, Haltmann is willing to do whatever he can to make his 
        company profit (it's in his name!). In his case, it means invading and mechanizing 
        other planets for their resources. The last part actually sounds pretty familiar 
        but I won't say anything else about it.
      </p>
      <p>He believes he's intellectually superior to the natives of other planets and feels 
        they are savages with no manners, which explains why he has no problems invading 
        their homes. Yes, he's a colonizer.
      </p>

      <img class="item-4x wideImage" src="../images/ExecutiveSuit.png" alt="Haltmann in his Executive Suit"></img>
    </div>
    <div class="item-4x CharacterPageBodyText">
      <p>Haltmann is very proud of his mech, the Executive Suit, with its gold body adorned 
        with lilac and red gems. He is also very proud of his hovering golden chair, which he 
        uses when he's not piloting his mech. Fit for a CEO, don't you think?
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="item-8x sectionSubheader">Before Kirby: Planet Robobot (Backstory)</h2>
    <div class="item-4x CharacterPageBodyText">
      <p>Haltmann and his daughter, Susie, used to travel throughout the cosmos together. At one 
        point discovered Star Dream, a wish-granting supercomputer, and its blueprints. He was 
        able to partially reactivate Star Dream with the help of the blueprints and by researching 
        the universe's most advanced civilizations.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="item-4x CharacterPageBodyText">
      <img class="item-4x wideImage" src="../images/HaltmannSusie.png" alt="Haltmann and Susie"></img>
    </div>
    <div class="item-8x CharacterPageBodyText">
      <p>Haltmann conducted tests on Star Dream regularly, until there was an accident, resulting in 
        Susie being warped to another dimension. Believing Susie had died, Haltmann decided to spend 
        all his time and energy into fully reactivating Star Dream. He hoped that he could revive his 
        daughter and see her again. However, he lost his memories of her the more he relied on Star 
        Dream.
      </p>
      <p>It turned out that Susie was not dead, but when she came back, Haltmann did not recognize her. 
        Haltmann ended up hiring her as secretary and administrative assistant of the Haltmann Works 
        Company, as deep down he felt she was familiar.
      </p>
      <p>With Susie now part of the Haltmann Works Company team, Haltmann was ready to proceed with his 
        business plan of eternal prosperity: the Mechanization Occupation Project.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="item-8x sectionSubheader">During Kirby: Planet Robobot</h2>
    <div class="item-8x CharacterPageBodyText">
      <p>The Haltmann Works Company's latest mechanization target is Planet Pop Star, thank to its large amount
        of resources and 'uncivilized' natives. Haltmann, however, doesn't appear in person until close to the 
        end of the game, when he introduces himself to Kirby and reveals his business plan and intents to destroy 
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Haltmann doesn't succeed (lol) and is knocked unconscious. Once he wakes up, he attempts to summon Star 
        Dream, who absorbs his soul and possesses him. Through Haltmann' body, Star Dream states that all life forms 
        are getting in the way of Haltmann's plans of economic prosperity.
      </p>
      <p>Kirby eventually manages to destroy Star Dream' original body, which results in the end of both 
        Star Dream and Haltmann. All of the planets that the Haltmann Works Company had mechanized were reverted 
        to their normal states.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="item-8x sectionSubheader">Non-Canon Information</h2>
    <div class="item-8x CharacterPageBodyText">
      <p>Star Dream Soul OS, fought in The True Arena, begins to erase Haltmann's soul as it's no longer 
        needed to function properly. While his soul is being erased, Haltmann wonders why he reactivated 
        a machine as terrible as Star Dream, and ultimately remembers Susie and his wish to see her again. 
        He regrets believing that Star Dream would have ever been able to grant that wish. Star Dream Soul 
        OS successfully deletes all remaining traces of Haltmann, including both his memories and soul.
